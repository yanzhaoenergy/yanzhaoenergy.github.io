<p>I am a Senior Engineer at <strong>Gas Technology Institute (GTI Energy)</strong>, a nonprofit research institute in the Chicago area. 
I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the <strong>University of California, Irvine</strong>.
My research focuses on both renewable and fossil-fuel energy systems. 
I investigate both conventional fossil fuels (e.g., natural gas, propane, and coal) and low-carbon or renewable fuels (e.g., hydrogen, biogas, ammonia, and methanol), 
as well as electricity-integrated energy systems including microgrids, fuel cells, heat pumps, IC/gas turbine engines, and solar photovoltaic technologies. </p>
