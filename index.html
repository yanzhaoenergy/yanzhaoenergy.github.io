<p>I am a Senior Engineer at GTI Energy, a nonprofit research institute in the Chicago area. 
I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the University of California, Irvine.
My research focuses on <strong>renewable and fossil fuel energy systems<strong>, at the intersection of <strong>Thermal Sciences<strong>, 
<strong>Environmental Impacts<strong>, and <strong>Technology Deployment<strong> in communities. <p>

<p><strong>Thermal Sciences:<strong><p>
<p>Fuel interchangeability (natural gas, hydrogen, ammonia, biogas, etc.), combustion, electrolysis<p>

<p><strong>Environmental Impacts:<strong><p>
Emissions reduction (NOₓ, CO, etc.), indoor air quality

<p><strong>Technology Deployment:<strong><p>
<p>Microgrids, gas pipeline blending, engagement with disadvantaged communities<p>
