<p>I am a Senior Engineer at Gas Technology Institute (GTI Energy), a nonprofit research institute in the Chicago area. 
I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the University of California, Irvine.
My research focuses on <strong>renewable and fossil fuel energy systems</strong>, at the intersection of Thermal Sciences, 
Environmental Impacts, and Technology Deployment in communities. </p>

<p><strong>Thermal Sciences:</strong>
Fuel interchangeability (natural gas, hydrogen, ammonia, biogas, etc.), combustion, electrolysis </p>

<p><strong>Environmental Impacts:</strong>
Emissions reduction (NOₓ, CO, etc.), indoor air quality</p>

<p><strong>Technology Deployment:</strong>
Microgrids, gas pipeline blending, engagement with disadvantaged communities</p>
