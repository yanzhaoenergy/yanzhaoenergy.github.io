<p>I am a Senior Engineer at <strong>Gas Technology Institute (GTI Energy)</strong>, a nonprofit research institute in the Chicago area. 
I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the <strong>University of California, Irvine</strong>.
My research focuses on renewable and fossil-fuel energy systems at the intersection of thermal–fluid sciences, 
environmental impact assessment, and community-scale technology deployment. 
I investigate both conventional fossil fuels (e.g., natural gas, propane, and coal) and low-carbon or renewable fuels (e.g., hydrogen, biogas, ammonia, and methanol), 
as well as electricity-integrated energy systems including microgrids, fuel cells, heat pumps, IC/gas turbine engines, and solar photovoltaic technologies. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thermal-Fluid Sciences:</strong>
Fuel interchangeability (natural gas, hydrogen, ammonia, biogas, etc.), Combustion, Electrolysis </li>

<li><strong>Environmental Impacts:</strong>
Emissions reduction (NOₓ, CO, etc.), Indoor air quality</li>

<li><strong>Technology Deployment:</strong>
Microgrids, Pipeline gas blending, Disadvantaged communities engagement</li>
</ul>
