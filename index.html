<p>I am a Senior Engineer at <strong>Gas Technology Institute (GTI Energy)</strong>, a nonprofit research institute in the Chicago area. 
I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the <strong>University of California, Irvine</strong>.
My research spans renewable and fossil-fuel energy systems, with a focus on both conventional fuels (natural gas, propane, coal) and low-carbon alternatives (hydrogen, biogas, ammonia, methanol). 
I also study electricity-integrated systems such as microgrids, fuel cells, heat pumps, internal combustion and gas turbine engines, and solar photovoltaics. </p>
